        cardContent: "What is a Karat?\r\n\r\nKarat is a measure of the purity of gold, abbreviated as K. As pure gold is very soft and cannot be used to make jewellery, metals like copper and silver are added to strengthen it. Karat measures the percentage of pure gold in the alloy and does not refer to the weight of gold as is commonly believed. Each karat indicates 1/24th of the whole - so if a piece of jewellery is made of 18 parts gold and 6 parts copper, the jewellery is of 18 karat gold.\r\n\r\n"
